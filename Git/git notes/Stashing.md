# Stashing

Suppose you are implementing a new feature for your product. your code is in progress and suddenly a customer escalation comes.

Because of this, you have to keep aside your new feature work for few hours.

You don't want to commit your partial code also won't throw away your changes. 

so, you need some temprory storage, where you can store partial changes and later on commit it.

`that is stash(temprory storage)`

Note:-> To stash an item only applies to modified files not new files.
